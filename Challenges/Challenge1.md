# Data Acquisition and Preparation

Approximately 400 nozzles per machine with 60 to 70 nozzles active during production

Machine-generated provides Pick and Place parametric information

- Data will be provided as JSON strings

Data to be organized into useful dataset to perform the calculations

## Measuring a successful Pick and Place
A successful pick and place operation must conclude with an electronic component placement
- ulplacements = ulpicks

Sometimes, a nozzle fails to pick up the electronic component, increasing the # of rejects
- ulplacements = ulpicks - ulrejects
