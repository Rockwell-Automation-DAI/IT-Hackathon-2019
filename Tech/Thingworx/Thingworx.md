## Thingworx platform and analytics   (Sajid and Mikica can give you slides)

### Predictive Modeling
Incorporates supervised machine learning into industrial IoT solutions and extends data science practices with automated predictive and prescriptive modeling – without the need for algorithm expertise by users
### Explanatory Analytics
 Enables better understanding of industrial IoT data, providing a variety of advanced algorithms that allows users to discover useful patterns and correlations within data
 ### Real-Time Monitoring
 Monitors data streams using a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques to learn “normal” conditions and identify unexpected changes in behavior
 ### Predictive Scoring
 Anticipates future outcomes and offers the ability to make relevant outcome-based predictions based on data within ThingWorx
